# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

Titanic survival prediction involves analyzing the dataset of Titanic passengers, exploring factors such as age, gender, class and embarked port to predict whether a passenger survived or not. The project aims to showcase the application of machine learning techniques, data analysis and feature engineering to extract meaningful insights from the dataset and build a reliable model for predicting survival outcomes based on various passenger attributes.


## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is provided by Kaggle.
## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

Python (>=3.6)

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn
## Approach

1. Data Preprocessing: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset. Missing values will be handled.

2. Feature Engineering: Features will be transformed or encoded as necessary. Feature selection applied to identify the most relevant features for prediction.

3. Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms will be evaluated such as Logistic Regression, KNeighborsClassifier, Random Forests.

4. Model Evaluation: The performance of model will be assessed using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Prediction: The best-performing model will be saved to predict the survival outcomes.
